Provisioning Delays → Accelerate Provisioning
Current project setup takes weeks due to Munas/EDL processes. We recommend defining SLA-driven workflows to reduce setup timelines to days.

Inconsistent Practices → Codify Best Practices
Lack of standardized guidance for local vs. cloud development creates inefficiencies. Publishing clear development guidelines will ensure consistency and speed.

Gaps in Testing → Strengthen Evaluation
Limited access to fairness, robustness, and compliance testing frameworks reduces model readiness. Expanding access will improve quality and trust in deployment.

Fragmented Governance → Enhance Accountability
Unclear ownership and disconnected processes slow decisions and duplicate effort. A defined governance model and roadmap will bring transparency and oversight.

Communication Gaps → Improve Alignment
No regular cadence exists to align on platform updates and priorities. Quarterly communications will provide visibility and enable proactive planning.

By aligning on these focus areas, we can significantly improve agility, transparency, and confidence in our GenAI initiatives while enabling teams to deliver at scale.
