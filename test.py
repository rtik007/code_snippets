As we continue scaling GenAI development, several challenges are slowing down progress and limiting effectiveness. Below is a consolidated view of the top priorities requiring leadership focus:

Key Challenges

Provisioning Delays – New project setup often takes weeks due to complex Munas/EDL processes and approvals. This impacts agility and speed to execution.

Lack of Standardized Best Practices – Inconsistent guidance for local vs. cloud development creates inefficiencies and confusion across teams.

Limited Evaluation & Testing Capabilities – Gaps in tools and frameworks for fairness, robustness, and compliance testing reduce confidence in production readiness.

Governance & Transparency – Fragmented processes and unclear ownership limit visibility, slow decision-making, and create duplication of effort.

Communication Gaps – No regular cadence to align on platform enhancements, priorities, and upcoming changes.

Recommended Priorities

Accelerate Provisioning: Define SLA-driven processes to reduce project setup time from weeks to days.

Codify Best Practices: Publish standardized guidance for development workflows to ensure consistency and efficiency.

Strengthen Evaluation: Broaden access to model testing frameworks to improve quality, security, and compliance.

Enhance Governance: Establish clearer accountability and a roadmap that balances flexibility with oversight.

Improve Alignment: Introduce quarterly communications to share updates and enable proactive planning.
